Site Overview:
The website is essentially an e-commerce platform built on PHP that lets users browse, search for products, register, log in, leave comments on things, and manage their accounts. An admin panel for controlling users and postings is also included. PHP and MySQL are used to build the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to create the frontend, which has a responsive design and dynamic content loading with AJAX.

Limitations:
Cart functionality is incomplete
No payment integration is implemented
No email verification or password recovery is implemented
The current architecture may not scale well with large user volumes.
